1297 Given this scenario, we expected that when appended to a dimeric cytokine receptor, JAK2 V617F would signal irrespective of the particular dimeric orientation of the receptor, and that other less active mutants (V617M, V617L, V617I) might still depend on a conformational change of a dimeric receptor
